## Overview

This trivia application allows users to test their knowledge on various topics through a series of fun and engaging questions. The application is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it a great project for beginners and intermediate developers alike.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Codux**: A tool for CSS and styling to enhance the appearance and responsiveness of the application.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/trivia-app.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd trivia-app
   ```
3. **Install the necessary dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Project

To run the project locally, use the following command:

## Trivia Questions

The trivia questions and correct answers used in the application are stored in a JSON object. Here is how I used it:
In this JSON object:
- Each question is an object within the "questions" array.
- Each question object contains:
  - A "question" string which is the trivia question.
  - A "choices" array which holds the possible answers.
  - A "correctAnswerIdx" which is the index of the correct answer in the "choices" array.

## Codux

The styling for this application is done using Codux, a free tool that simplifies the process of writing CSS. You can learn more about Codux and access it [here](https://codux.hopp.to/techwithtim).
